Hello Striver! 

I created a css file for each "component" of the page, so that you can analize them one by one.
The "style.css" file is the general layout of the page.
ALL media queries are in the media.css file

The carousel does not move, but I think it can be very intersting for you understanding how I built the structure. 

I decided to populate the images with javascript, you can find code + explanation on index.js

Cheers and happy coding!
